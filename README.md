## How to use the App

Open a browser and head to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Once open, feel free to type any address starting with the numeric identifier.
If a portion of data catches the eye, click a card to be routed to the listing.

Also feel free to edit the .csv file on the server and add, remove, or change data.
The frontend will reflect these changes.
**NOTE: the .csv file should be sorted by address for the binary search to work correctly**
